    "# Class Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, the concept of **inheritance** is crucial to implementing concepts important to OOP design. Inheritance is a method for a newly declared _subclass_ (the inheriting class) to inherit methods, attributes, and properties from a _superclass_ (the parent class). A class can act as both a subclass and a superclass, meaning entire inheritance heirarchies can be generated. This form of classification that should seem intuitive to how human beings classify things in ever more detail; I tend to see a class inheritance heirarchy akin to taxanomy classification in biology, with the higher levels (Domain, kingdom), being broad classifications and encomposing more organisms, while the lower levels (genus, species) are much more detailed in their descriptions, describing ever smaller subset of organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a complex subject; this section is intended to give a high level overview, with just enough detail where it can be recognized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is inheritance useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is useful in both an abstract and a practical sense. In abstract, inheritance can be useful in the form described in the taxonomic example above; that is, it can be used to organize classes that represent similar constructs. Practically, inheritance encourages code reuse; if a group of classes share common behaviors (or at least common calls), than one should consider having them inherit from a common subclass. Additionally, inheritance allows for building upon, or _expanding_, an existing framework without having to know its full inner workings. For example, [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) is a comprehensive framework for building cross-platform Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), which sometimes needs to be extended for specific applications. For BLOSOM, we created a custom color well button for choosing custom colors. This was accomplished by subclassing Qt's `QPushButton` class, overriding the `paintEvent()` method with custom draw behavior, and adding a few additional methods for loading the color picker and selecting specific colors. All other UI management for the button is handled by the parent classes. FYI, this particular case is common enough that several recipes exist for creating a colorwell button in Qt; the one we referenced can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17033643).\n",

However, there are times where you may need to include it, or see other implementations which have; in that case, you'll likely see somthing along the lines of `super(<p.class>).__init__()`, where `<p.class>` is the name of the superclass._\n",
