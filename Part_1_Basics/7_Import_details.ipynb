    "Generally speaking, importing allows a programmer to access functionality defined outside of their own code. Imports work on **modules** and **packages**. Any existing Python script can be imported as a module, exposing any variables, functions, and/or classes declared within. A package, however, is a directory structure containing one or more modules; larger codebases, such as numpy, are typically distributed as packages.\n",

    "## Importing your script as a module\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, any Python script can be imported as a module, including your own. Perhaps you have some functions declared that you'd like to use in another script; importing your script as a module is an easy way to accomplish this. \n",

    "```python\n",

    "When a script is imported as a module, the `__name__` variable is set to the name of the module; however, when a script is directly executed by Python, the `__name__` variable is set to `__main__`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit to using the `if __name__==\"__main__\":` statement is that you give a clue to other programmers as to where your script logic actually starts. Get into the habit of including this guard in your code, and you'll avoid painful bugs in the future."
