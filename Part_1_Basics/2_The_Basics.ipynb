There are several advantages to this approach; here are just a few:\n",
    "* The python language and interpreter do not have to worry about what computer platform they are executed on; this is handled by the PVM.\n",
    "* Automated Resource management (ie memory allocation/deallocation) is easier to implement; the programmer does not have to come up with their own memory management scheme.\n",
