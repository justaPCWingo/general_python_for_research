    "Loops are critical constructs in computer program. In Python, loops come in two flavors: while-loops and for-loops. **while-loops** repeat a set of instructions until a condition statement returns `False`. Oftentimes, this means updating a variable within the loop scope that is also involved in the condition statement, understanding that the manipulation is converging on a condition where the condition statement is `False`. A loop whose condition statement always returns `True` is known as an *infinite loop*; such loops can only be exited through alternative means, one of which is explained later in this section. "
