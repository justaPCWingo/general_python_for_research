    "## Python 2 vs. Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Presently, there are two branches of python competing with one another (sort of). The **Python 2.x** branch is older, and is eventually to be replaced by the newer edition, **Python 3.x**. There are enough differences between the syntax and implementations of Python 2 and Python 3 that there is an *API break*, meaning code written in one version is not gauruanteed to work in the other. Python 2 is considered *Deprecated* in many circles, and general consensus is to use Python 3 when available. There are still a handful of tools (namely in GIS) that have not completed the transition to Python 3, and thus the supporting community is stuck using python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expect to use Python 3, except when working with older code, or within circles that still use Python 2 (namely GIS). There are a number of differences, but the most obvious one is the `print` statement in each version of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python 2 print statement looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print \"Hi there!\"```\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python 3 print statement looks something like this:\n",

Depending on the edition of ArcGIS, the installed python may be set at Python 2. To install Python 3, see the next option.\n",
