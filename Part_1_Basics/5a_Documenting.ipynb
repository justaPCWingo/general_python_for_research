    "  * A description of the return values, if any.\n",

While many folks prefer [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) since its the default syntax recognized by Sphinx, I generally recommend [google-style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) docstrings since they easier to read and still parsable by documentation tools.\n",
