# Wingo's Python Tutorials For research

These notebooks have been compiled as a service for several of my colleagues who know a little python for scripting, but would like to develop more robust, flexible code.

## Who's this for?

Anyone who is interested in learning some basic python, with a slant toward the data sciences.

## Why not teach using package XX? 

I'm attempting to first provide a solid foundation of how python works and what it can do instead of teaching to a basic package. However, focus on some basic datascience modules/packages, such as [numpy](https://www.numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://www.matplotlib.org), will be introduced fairly early. Other, more advanced frameworks (such as UI libraries) will be discussed and included as requested.

## Why present using Jupyter notebooks?

A few resaons; namely:
* The notebooks allow the free mingling of Python code and decorated text.
* Allows for interactive code presentation, allowing the user to play with the code.
* Jupyter notebooks are directly viewable in github.
* Each person can download their own separate copy to add their own notes, etc.
